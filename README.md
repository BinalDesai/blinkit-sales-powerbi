# Blinkit Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing Blinkitâ€™s retail sales data to uncover insights on product performance, customer behavior, and outlet characteristics. The goal is to support business stakeholders in understanding key sales drivers and making data-informed decisions for optimization.

## Tech Stack
- **SQL:** Data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards and data visualization
- **Excel:** Data review and formatting (optional)

## Data Source
The dataset was sourced from a [[YouTube tutorial]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phs0SLj86ek&t=9584s)(#) which provided the Blinkit sales dataset for practice purposes via the video description.

> **Note:** This data is used strictly for educational and demonstration purposes only.

It includes fields like:
- Item details (Type, Fat Content)
- Sales amount
- Customer ratings
- Outlet information (Location, Size, Establishment Year, Type)

## Features & Highlights

### Data Cleaning
- Standardized inconsistent values in `Item_Fat_Content` (e.g., mapping 'LF' and 'low fat' to 'Low Fat', 'reg' to 'Regular') for reliable analysis.

### Key Metrics (KPIs)
- **Total Sales**  
- **Average Sales per Order**  
- **Number of Orders**  
- **Average Customer Rating**

### Business Questions Answered
1. **How does fat content impact sales performance and customer ratings?**
2. **Which item types generate the highest revenue?**
3. **Does outlet size or location influence total sales?**
4. **Are newer outlets performing better than older ones?**
5. **Which outlet types yield the highest average sales and ratings?**

### Dashboards Created in Power BI
- **KPI Summary Dashboard**
- **Sales by Fat Content**
- **Sales by Item Type**
- **Sales by Outlet Size & Location**
- **Customer Rating Trends**
- **Outlet Establishment Year vs. Sales**
